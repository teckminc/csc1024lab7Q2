2.	Define a function name get_random (user-defined function) that 
will ask the user to pick a low and a high number, and then 
generate a random number between those two values and return the 
random number as value.

Define another function name guess_number (user-defined function) that 
will give the instruction 'I am thinking of a number...' and t
hen ask the user to guess the number they are thinking of and 
return the user guessed number.

Define a third function display_result (user-defined function) that 
will received the input values the random number and the guess number 
and check to see if the random number is the same as the userâ€™s guess. 
If it is, it should display the message 'Correct, you win', otherwise 
it should keep looping, telling the user if they are too low or 
too high and asking them to guess again until they guess correctly.

Write a program that will used the above 3 functions which will 
prompt user for a number and the program will generate a 
random number. Program should display the message 'Correct, you win'
when random number is equal to guess, 
otherwise it should keep looping, telling the user if they are 
too low or too high and asking them to guess again until they guess 
correctly.

Sample Program output:

Enter low number:1
Enter high number: 10
I am thinking of a number...
What am i thinking of: 1
Too low, try again:10
Too high, try again:6
Too high, try again:4
Correct, you win

Function to use: int(), input(), print(), random.randint(),
